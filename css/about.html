					<p>Hi, Welcome to my personal website. I'm a 3rd-year Cognitive Science student(Spec in Design & Interaction) at the University of Califonia San Diego(UCSD). As a design student, I strive to stay on the cutting-edge trend of design concepts and commit to producing user-friendly products that deliver a satisfying user experience. Being a rookie in the industry, I look forward to applying my technical skills and creativity to my future employers in the pursuit of a better self and future.</p> 

					<p>I would describe myself as a mix of introvert and extrovert. One of the hobbies that I do during my free time is playing video games and watching anime. However, I also spend lots of time outside, including playing basketball and being a travel enthusiast. Also, I am an easy-going person who usually gets along with other people, which makes me believe that I could become a nice addition to a company's working team.</p>
